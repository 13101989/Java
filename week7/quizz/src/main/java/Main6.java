/**
 * You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface (area) and perimeter for multiple types of shape:
 * rectangle, square, circle and triangle.
 * <p>
 * For each shape you must memorize coordinate points for it's vertices.
 * <p>
 * A square is made of a top left vertex and a bottom left vertex, with the restriction that the difference in x and y coordinates
 * between the 2 points is the same.
 * A rectangle is the same as a square, without the restriction. A triangle has 3 vertices.
 * A circle has 1 vertex as center and a radius.
 * <p>
 * The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for the surface from all the
 * shapes in the system.
 * The application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool. In case 2 similar shapes are added,
 * an appropriate message should be printed to console. 2 shapes are considered similar if they have the same surface and perimeter and
 * are of the same type.
 * Since you want to be sure that you provide a high quality implementation, unit tests are needed to prove the main functionalities
 * described above work correctly (add all types of shapes, add duplicates, add single shape and pairs of shapes).
 * To deliver the work, just make a zip file with the src folder (main and test) and attach it to the answer.
